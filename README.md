It sure is. The above quote is my favorite. It's through building that we learn how things work or should work. Using the code that others written is convinient, but if we want to be the person that others use, we should start building.

This project is my attempt to learn how template engines work. I called it Ash — One of the operators in Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6 Siege Video Game. You can read the code and pick some ideas to build your own template engine. I also went further and implemented tests and added TypeScript so everyone — including future myself — can understand the code better. I also learned provided some examples in [examples folder](https://github.com/amirhoseinsalimi/my-own-template-engine-in-ts/tree/master/examples).
