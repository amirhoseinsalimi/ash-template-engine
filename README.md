It sure is. The above quote is my favorite. It's through building that we learn
how things work or should work. Using the code that others have written is
convenient, but if we want to be the person who writes code that other
programmers use, we should start building. Visit the golden GitHub repository 
[Build Your Own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) to find
some notions.

This project is my attempt to learn how template engines work. I called it Ash 
— One of the operators in Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6 Siege Video Game. You can read
the code and pick some ideas to build your own template engine. I also went
further and implemented tests and added TypeScript so everyone — including
future myself — can understand the code better. I provided some examples in 
[examples folder](https://github.com/amirhoseinsalimi/ash-template-engine/tree/master/examples)
as well.
